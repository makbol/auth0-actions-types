  Store and retrieve data that persists across executions.
  api.cache.delete(key)
  
    Delete a record describing a cached value at the supplied key if it exists.
  
  
    Returns a CacheWriteResult object with  type: "success" if a value was removed from the cache. A failed operation returns type: "error". For errors, the returned object will have a
    code property that indicates the nature of the failure.
  
  
    
      
        Parameter
        Description

  api.cache.get(key)

    be found at the value property of the returned object.
  
  
    Returns a cache record if an item is found in the cache for the supplied
    key. Cache records are objects with a
    value property holding the cached value as well as an
    expires_at property indicating the maximum expiry of
    the record in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
  
  
    Important:
    This cache is designed for short-lived, ephemeral data. Items may not be

    Values stored in this cache are scoped to the Trigger in which they are set.
    They are subject to the
    Actions Cache Limits.
  
  
    Values stored in this way will have lifetimes of up to the specified
    ttl or expires_at values. If no lifetime is
    specified, a default of lifetime of 15 minutes will be used. Lifetimes may
    not exceed the maximum duration listed at
    Actions Cache Limits.
